# ContestsApp

#### By: Philip Putnam

### Description:

<p>
  Following a Lynda.com tutorial for a full-stack JavaScript program by Samer Buna, this is a naming contests application. The application features React on the frontend consuming data delivered via Node and Express API endpoints after querying a Mongo Database. It also features server-side rendering for the small performance increase, search engine optimization (SEO), and JavaScript-free rendering.  
</p>

### Instructions:

<p>
  You will need a MongoDB server running locally for this install, as well as nodemon & git globally and these instructions assume a bash terminal interface. All instructions beginning with a dollar sigh ($) indicate a bash terminal command, the dollar sign can be omitted, type everything else verbatim.
</p>

<p>
  If you do not have babel-node installed globally or have your path variable configured, you may need to type the full relative path (i.e. /node_modules/babel-cli/bin/babel-node.js) in its place (followed by the rest of the instruction step).
</p>

<ol>
  <li>In the bash terminal, navigate to your desired project location then type:</li>
  <li>$ git clone https://github.com/philip-putnam/ContestsApp-React-Mongo-Node</li>
  <li>$ cd ContestsApp-React-Mongo-Node</li>
  <li>$ npm install</li>
  <li>Start your MongoDB server</li>
  <li>$ babel-node updateTestData.js</li>
  <li>$ npm run start</li>
  <li>In a browser, navigate to localhost:8080</li>
</ol>
